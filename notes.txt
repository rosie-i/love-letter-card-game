Assets:
- Character cards (x21)
- Favor tokens

Setup:
- Shuffle the character cards to create the deck (will need to work out how many of each, may differ by num of players)
- Set aside one card from deck (discarded to stop card counting - should not be visible to players)
- Deal each player one card as their starting hand
- Randomise starting player

Gameplay - player turn:
- Draw one card from deck
- Player chooses which of the two cards to play, and resolves effect
---> This may affect other players' hands, status in the round, etc.
- The played card goes to the played pile (according to the official rules, it actually stays faceup in your play area)
- All played and discarded cards should be visible to everyone (but might be good to implement an option to hide this, to make it harder)
- Differentiate between playing and discarding a card - similar mechanic with different effects

Round end:
- If no cards remain in deck:
---> After every turn, check if the deck is empty - all players still in round reveal and compare the card in their hands
---> Highest card wins the round. If there is a tie, all players win the round and gain a token each

- When only one player is left in round
---> Check remaining players every time a player is knocked out
---> When round ends, determine the winner and award them a favor token

- The next round starts with the winner of the previous round - if there's a tie, decide randomly between tied players

Game end:
- When a round ends, and favor token(s) have been handed out, check if the game should end
- Num of tokens to win is different depending on num of players - can implement later


Additional feature thoughts:
- Keyboard shortcuts!
- Game log - assign colour for each player and highlight their names in log
- Animations! Smooooth transitions.


TODO:

- When deck is empty, show the empty pile img instead of card back
- When it is not your turn, card hover/click state shouldn't respond

- Modal should show you result of playing your card
-- Should also show other players, but might be more complicated... Ideas:
-- (Though could have a G.moveOutcome obj which is replaced when playCard is called + resolved)
-- Should have moveOutcome.seenBy[playerID] = false;
-- Then when clients get a state update, update their UI (if they have not seen it) and set seenBy them to true
-- Then can just replace it every time we make a new move

- Be nice to implement a new round countdown, make it more obvious when round is over
--- in roundScoreAndCleanup phase onBegin hook - in else block
                else {
                    // Start next round - ADD SOME VISUAL FEEDBACK WITH A 'Next round beginning in 3... 2... 1... ' TIMER HERE!
                    events.setPhase('roundPlay');
                }

*** NEXT!
-  If card does not have target (bc Handmaid or whatever) when it should, resolve that in card effect function in Game.js! 
----> It's causing errors bc i'm calling things like G.playerMap[**undefinedID passed through**].hand

- Implement modal to show card playing result - specifically bc you need it for Priest to be implemented!
